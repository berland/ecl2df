Installation
============

Internally in Equinor, ecl2df is distributed through Komodo and
nothing is needed besides activating Komodo, typically through::

  source /prog/res/komodo/stable/enable

On Linux computers outside Equinor, ecl2df should be installed from pypi:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install ecl2df

For MacOS, the OPM dependency is not available from pypi, and OPM must be
compiled manually.
